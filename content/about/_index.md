    title: "Why did we build Rivet?"
    teaser: 'We recognized that the lack of standard design patterns in software development <a href="../blog/why-we-built-rivet/">led to disjointed user experiences</a>. A design system contains assets developers can use to create patterns across software titles. It also gathers input from designers and developers university-wide to solve problems and suggest solutions. Rivet’s single source of assets makes it easier to work on and maintain projects.'
