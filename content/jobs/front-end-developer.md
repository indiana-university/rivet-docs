## About the User Experience Office
The User Experience Office (UXO) at Indiana University takes a holistic approach to creating simple, inclusive digital experiences. UXO collaborates with university partners to help them apply user experience principles and best practices to their projects.

## The Role of the UXO Design System team

The role of the UXO Design System team is to:

- Help create and ensure design consistency, quality, and accessibility across IU’s digital systems and services
- Increase the efficiency of design and front-end development by building tools that help designers and developers focus on solving problems instead of implementation details
- Provide training and resources to help all members of the organization improve their design fluency

## Responsibilities
As a front-end developer on our Design System team you will:

- Establish front-end patterns and practices that ensure accessible and highly-usable digital systems and services
- Work closely with designers to help grow our design system and keep it relevant
- Help refactor the codebase to make it more modular, scalable, and well-documented
- Help make decisions about front-end technologies we’ll use to develop and evolve our design system
- Write clear, concise, and approachable documentation for every skill level

## Requirements
Our ideal candidate has:

- Experience maintaining and scaling design systems
- Experience writing modular, modern JavaScript. Although using frameworks like React and Vue will be a part of the Front-end Developer’s responsibility, we are looking for someone with strong knowledge of vanilla JavaScript.
- Experience writing modular, scalable CSS using a preprocessor like Sass
- Experience evaulating the accessibility, readability, and performance of front-end code
- Enthusiasm about design systems and front-end architecture 
- A commitment to ongoing learning about principles, best practices, and tools

When applying, please provide examples of your work, including:

- Pattern libraries or style guides you have created
- GitHub repositories with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS/Sass you have written
- Links to any visual design work you’ve done in the past
- Samples/links to any writing you may have done, including documentation
