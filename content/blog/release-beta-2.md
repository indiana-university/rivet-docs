## Link hub component

This releases introduces the new [link hub component](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/link-hub/), which allows you to show a list of links with optional descriptions.

Link hubs are often used on website home pages, section index pages, and landing pages to guide the user toward resources related to a single topic. The link hub has both single-column and grid variants.

## New width utility classes

This release adds the `.rvt-width-3-xl` and `.rvt-width-4-xl` [width utility classes](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/utilities/width/).

These new CSS classes bring the width utilities in line with the sizes offered by the spacing utilities.

## Component JavaScript refactor

The JavaScript code powering many of Rivet's components has been rewritten.

While this does not affect the functionality of components, it provides some much-needed improvement to the maintainability of the code for the Rivet team.
