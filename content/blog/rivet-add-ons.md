Rivet Add-ons are components, plugins, and other utilities that can be included in Rivet projects on an as-needed basis.

## Why Add-ons?
We know that Rivet won't have a ready-made solution for every design problem. Sometimes, you'll need to build your own solution to solve problems specific to your app's use case.

We've created Add-ons for a few reasons:

1. To make it easier to build use case-specific Rivet components that can be shared with other developers solving similar problems
2. To release components separate from the Rivet core that are opt-in. This helps make Rivet flexible while keeping its core simple and lightweight.
3. To foster a Rivet ecosystem and encourage collaboration across teams

## Using Rivet Add-ons
We've added a new section to the Rivet website where you can find a list of available Add-ons, along with instructions on how to use Add-ons in your project.

Each Add-on page contains:

- Links to download the code needed to use the Add-on
- A link to the GitHub repository that hosts the Add-on's source code
- A demo page showing a working example of the Add-on

## Creating issues for Rivet Add-ons
If you have a question, want to report a bug, or have a feature request, create a GitHub issue on the Add-on repository.

To create an issue for a Rivet Add-on:

1. Create a [github.com](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one
2. Go to the [Rivet Add-ons page][add-ons-page]
3. Open the page for the Add-on by clicking its name or screenshot in the list
4. Click the `Source` link in the toolbar to open the Add-on's GitHub repository
5. Click the `Issues` tab and create your new issue

## Have an idea for an Add-on?
If you've created a custom Rivet component you think might be useful to other teams, we've created a Rivet [Add-on boilerplate repository][boilerplate] to help you develop your own Add-on in a way that will match the style and structure of other Add-ons.

If you need help developing your Add-on, the Rivet core team is happy to help with visual design, front-end development, and accesibility.
