This week, we published the [fifth alpha release of Rivet](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.5) to GitHub. This alpha release includes a redesign of the card component and new components built for marketing websites.

[Learn more about alpha releases](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/getting-started/alpha/)

## Card

Previously a variant of the deprecated box component, the redesigned [card](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/card/) is now a standalone component.

The card component is commonly used on both web applications and marketing websites to group related pieces of information. Cards are also used to present collections of content, such as news items, in a list or grid format.

## Billboard

The [billboard](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/billboard/) is a new component for marketing websites based on work the Rivet team did as part of the [iu.edu](https://iu.edu/index.html) redesign.

By combining an image, a headline, teaser text, and a call to action, the billboard component helps guide visitors to news articles, student and alumni stories, or other important content.

## Quote

Another new component for marketing websites, the [quote](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/quote/) can be used to highlight compelling testimonials from people like students, alumni, faculty, and administrators.

## Call to action

The [call to action](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/call-to-action/) component is a link with added visual emphasis.

Calls to action can be used within another component (like a card) or on their own at the end of running text.

## Sidenav

A versatile component usable in many different kinds of sites and applications, the [sidenav](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/sidenav/) can be used to add vertical navigation to a page's sidebar.

The sidenav component is primarily designed for section navigation (as seen on [iu.edu](https://www.iu.edu/academics/choosing-a-major.html)) and supports nested navigation up to four levels deep.

## Header and footer

In our previous blog post, we provided a first look at [Rivet's new header system]({{< ref "./alpha-header.md" >}}) and introduced some enhancements we're making to component documentation.

A preview of [Rivet's new footer system](https://rvtnext.sitehost-test.iu.edu/docs/components/footer/) is also available. Like the header, the footer is similar to those you might have seen on the recently relaunched [iu.edu](https://iu.edu), [uits.iu.edu](https://uits.iu.edu), and [covid.iu.edu](https://covid.iu.edu) websites.

## Leaving feedback

The new version of Rivet is still in development and we plan to continue iterating on the code, components, and documentation. We welcome your suggestions during this process.
