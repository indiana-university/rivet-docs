This week, we published the [fifth alpha release of Rivet](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.5) to GitHub. This alpha release adds a number of components, including a redesign of the card component and new components specific to marketing websites.

[Learn more about alpha releases](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/getting-started/alpha/)

## Card

Once a variant of the now-deprecated box component, the [card](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/card/) is now a standalone component.

The card is commonly used in both web applications and marketing websites to group and call out related pieces of information. Cards are also used to present collections of content, such as news items, in a list or grid format.

## Billboard

The [billboard](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/billboard/) is a new component for marketing websites based on work we did as part of the [IU Gateway](https://iu.edu/index.html) redesign.

By combining an image, a headline, summary text, and a call to action, the billboard component is designed to guide visitors to news articles, student or alumni stories, and other important content.

## Quote

Another new component for marketing websites, the [quote](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/quote/) can be used to highlight compelling testimonials from people like students, alumni, faculty, and administrators.

## Call to action

The [call to action](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/call-to-action/) component is a special link variant with added visual emphasis.

Calls to action can be used within another component (like a card) or on their own at the end of running text.

## Sidenav

A versatile component usable across many different kinds of sites and applications, the [sidenav](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/quote/) can be used to add vertical navigation to a page's sidebar.

The sidenav is primarily designed for section navigation (as seen on [iu.edu](https://www.iu.edu/academics/choosing-a-major.html)) and supports nested navigation up to four levels deep.

## Header and Footer

In our [previous blog post]({{< ref "./alpha-header.md" >}}), we provided a first look at Rivet's new header system and introduced some enhancements we're making to component documentation.

A preview of the [Rivet's new footer system](https://rvtnext.sitehost-test.iu.edu/docs/components/footer/) is also available. Like the header, the footer is similar to those you might have seen on the recently relaunched [iu.edu](https://iu.edu), [uits.iu.edu](https://uits.iu.edu), and [covid.iu.edu](https://covid.iu.edu) websites.

## Leaving feedback

The new version of the Rivet is still in development and we plan to continue iterating on the code, components, and documentation. We welcome your suggestions during this process.
