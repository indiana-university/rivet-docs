This week, we published the [third beta release of Rivet 2](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.3) to GitHub. This release updates accordion, badge, and button visual styles.

## Updated accordion styles

This release updates [accordion](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/accordion/) component styles to be more consistent with the appearance of the recently released [link hub](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/link-hub/) component.

## Updated badge and button styles

This release updates [badge](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/badge/) and [button](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/button/) component styles to improve consistency, legibility, and contrast.

The secondary button styles in particular have been adjusted to help make them more distinct when used alongside primary buttons.

## Complete list of changes
