This week, we published the [third beta release of Rivet 2](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.3) to GitHub. This release adds new button variants and updates accordion, badge, and button styles.

## New button variants

This release introduces the new [link button variant](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/button/). This variant behaves like a native `button` element but has the appearance of a text link. This variant can be useful where space in an interface is limited.

This release also introduces a button variant to the [call to action](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/call-to-action/) component. Originally, call to action buttons only appeared in the [hero](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/hero/) componentâ€”they can now be used anywhere.

## Updated accordion styles

This release updates [accordion](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/badge/) component styles to be more consistent with the appearance of the recently released [link hub](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/link-hub/) component.

## Updated badge and button styles

This release updates [badge](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/badge/) and [button](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/button/) component styles to improve consistency, legibility, and contrast.

The secondary button styles in particular have been adjusted to help make them more distinct when used alongside primary buttons.
