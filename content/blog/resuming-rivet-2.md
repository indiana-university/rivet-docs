In early spring, the [Digital Campus](https://studios.iu.edu/about/teams/digital-campus/) team responsible for Rivet paused development of version 2. Like many teams across IU responding to COVID-19, they were temporarily reassigned to projects with more immediate needs.

While supporting digital environments for teaching, learning, and research will remain an important aspect of the Digital Campus team’s work in the future, we’re taking steps to resume development of Rivet 2 this fall. We will be updating our development plan, with a renewed focus on creating a holistic design system that works across platforms, strengthens our communication efforts, and improves the user experience of our many software and web systems.

Over the next two months, we’ll share a revised timeline for development, publish additional [Requests for Comment (RFCs)](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/rfcs/), and resume making alpha releases for early adopters to begin testing. If you have questions or comments for the team at any point, please reach out to [rivet@iu.edu](mailto:rivet@iu.edu).

We appreciate the IU community’s patience as we balance this work with efforts related to the health, safety, and ongoing success of IU, and we look forward to collaborating in the future.
