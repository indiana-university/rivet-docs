## Header component preview

Our [recent Rivet 2 alpha release](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.4) included a first iteration of the redesigned Rivet header component. This new header is similar to the headers you might have seen on [iu.edu](https://iu.edu), [uits.iu.edu](https://uits.iu.edu), and [covid.iu.edu](https://covid.iu.edu).

You can see an interactive preview of the new header on [v2.rivet.iu.edu](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/). This preview also contains code examples and implementation notes for development teams using the Rivet 2 alpha.

## New documentation features

As part of the alpha development process, we've also been exploring some enhancements to how Rivet components are documented.

In the header preview linked above, you'll notice two new features attached to code examples:

- **Full-screen preview**. Code examples can be viewed in isolation in a new browser tab. This feature is intended to help give developers a distraction-free way to see how a component looks and works.
- **Edit in CodePen**. Code examples can be edited directly in CodePen. This feature is intended to provide developers with a sandbox in which they can quickly experiment with components without needing to set up a local development environment.

## Leaving feedback

The new version of the Rivet header is still in development and we plan to continue iterating on it over the coming months. We welcome your suggestions during this process.

To leave feedback on the header preview, [post a comment to our GitHub Discussions thread](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/discussions/467) or send a message to [rivet@iu.edu](mailto:rivet@iu.edu).
