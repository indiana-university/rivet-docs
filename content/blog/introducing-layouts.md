Last week, we published the [sixth alpha release of Rivet](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.6) to GitHub. This alpha release includes **layouts**, a new concept we're introducing in Rivet 2.

## What are layouts?

Rivet layouts are prebuilt IU-branded page templates you can use for your websites or applications. These layouts are designed to help give you a head start in creating many of the page types commonly used across IUâ€™s web space.

This latest alpha release features a number of layouts designed for use with marketing and informational websites. More layouts will be added in future alpha releases, including those designed for web applications.

## How are layouts used?

Layouts are provided as downloadable HTML files. Use layouts as they appear or adjust them to meet your specific needs. The markup for each layout can also be adapted for use in a templating language like Velocity.

Because layouts are just plain HTML pages that import Rivet CSS and JavaScript, you can modify them using any of the components or utility classes that Rivet provides.

## Leaving feedback

The new version of Rivet is still in development and we plan to continue iterating on the code, components, layouts, and documentation. We welcome your suggestions during this process.
