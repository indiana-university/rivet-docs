Thanks to those of you who were able to join us for the first-ever Rivet Community Workshop last week!

It was great meeting all of the many developers who use Rivet, and based on the feedback we received, it sounds like the event added a lot of value for folks. We also got some great insights from developers on how to improve the workshop in the fall, which we're very grateful for.

## Slide decks

Below are links to the slide decks used in the four tutorial track lessons and the Rivet project share.

Unfortunately, we were unable to get recordings for this workshop. However, we're committed to having all presentations recorded at the fall workshop for those who can't make it in person.
