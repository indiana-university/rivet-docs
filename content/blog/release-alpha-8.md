Last week, we published [Rivet 2.0.0-alpha.8](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.8) to GitHub. This release streamlines component documentation, introduces new utilities, updates colors to align with the new brand palette, and more.

## Streamlined component documentation

As of this release, **all planned [Rivet 2 components](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/) are now documented**.

Documentation for each component has been rewritten into a more concise bullet point-oriented format. Our hope is that this format makes important information about how to use a component easier to find at a glance.

We plan to continue iterating on component documentation in the coming months, particularly as it relates to highlighting information about accessibility and JavaScript.

## New shadow utilities

This release introduces [shadow utilities](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/utilities/shadow/). Shadow utilities can be used to add box shadows to elements.

## New font utilities

This release introduces [text utility classes](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/utilities/typography/#font-family) that can be used to set an element's font to Benton Sans or Georgia Pro.

## Updated colors

This release updates [Rivet's colors](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/utilities/color/) to align with the new brand palette.

## Disclosure component

This release adds styles and documentation for the [disclosure component](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/docs/components/disclosure/).

The disclosure component can be used to allow someone to show or hide additional content about a topic.

## Complete list of updates

See the [Rivet 2 changelog](https://v2.rivet.iu.edu/getting-started/changelog/) for a complete list of updates in Rivet `2.0.0-alpha.8`.

## Leaving feedback

The new version of Rivet is still in development and we plan to continue iterating on the code, components, layouts, and documentation. We welcome your suggestions during this process.
