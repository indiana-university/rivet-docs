Earlier this month, Rivet was featured on [Web Axe's Accessible Code Libraries and Design Patterns list](http://www.webaxe.org/web-accessible-code-library-design-systems-patterns/).

Web Axe, a prominent blog that discusses topics related to web accessibility, recommended Rivet alongside industry-leading design systems created by the [U.S. government](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov/), [GOV.UK](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), [Salesforce](http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/), [Shopify](https://polaris.shopify.com/), and others.

While our team had to shift its focus last year to priorities related to IU's coronavirus response, we're committed to making progress on the next generation of the Rivet design system in 2021.

Rivet's scope will widen to include tools for informational websites, marketing emails, and other digital properties, but as always accessibility will remain a core guiding principle of Rivet's development.
